## Introduction paragraph
 
The introduction paragraph is the first paragraph of your essay, and it has three main functions: to introduce the topic and context, to present your thesis statement (the main claim or argument of your essay), and to outline the structure of your essay. A good introduction paragraph should:
 
- Start with a hook, a sentence that catches the reader's attention and motivates them to read on. For example, you can use a surprising fact, a relevant quotation, a question or a problem statement.
- Provide some background information on the topic and context, explaining why it is important or interesting for your audience. For example, you can give some historical, cultural, social or academic context.
- End with your thesis statement, a concise sentence that states your main claim or argument and how you will support it in your essay. For example, you can use words like "This essay will argue that...", "This essay will demonstrate that..." or "This essay will analyse how...".
