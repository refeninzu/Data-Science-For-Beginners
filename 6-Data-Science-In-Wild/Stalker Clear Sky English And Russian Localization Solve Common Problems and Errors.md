However, some players may encounter difficulties in installing the language packs or switching between them. In this article, we will show you how to install Stalker Clear Sky English and Russian localization and how to change the language settings in the game.
 
## Installing Stalker Clear Sky English And Russian Localization
 
The first step to install Stalker Clear Sky English and Russian localization is to download the language packs from the official website of GSC Game World. You can find them [here](http://www.gsc-game.com/index.php?t=downloads&ss=299&s=patch). There are two files for each language: one for the text and subtitles, and one for the voiceovers. You need to download both files for each language you want to install.
 
The second step is to extract the files from the downloaded archives. You can use any program that can handle zip or rar files, such as WinRAR or 7-Zip. You should extract the files to a folder on your computer, such as your desktop or downloads folder.
 
The third step is to copy the extracted files to the game folder. You need to locate the folder where you installed Stalker Clear Sky on your computer. It is usually in C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Stalker Clear Sky or C:\Program Files (x86)\GSC World Publishing\Stalker Clear Sky. You should copy the files from the extracted folders to the corresponding folders in the game folder. For example, if you want to install English text and subtitles, you should copy the files from eng\text folder to gamedata\text folder in the game folder. If you want to install Russian voiceovers, you should copy the files from rus\sounds folder to gamedata\sounds folder in the game folder.
 
The fourth step is to edit the fsgame.ltx file in the game folder. This file contains some settings that affect how the game runs. You need to open it with a text editor, such as Notepad or Notepad++. You should find a line that says:
